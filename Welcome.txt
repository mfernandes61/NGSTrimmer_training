fastqc is also supplied for you to check the data before and after trimming.
It is planned to have an advanced exercise involving comparing mapping success 
between raw and trimmed data to a refernce genome.

*** NB ****
In Kitematic you will need to map the volume /coursehome to a directory 
on your hard disk. Next stop then start the container (buttons towards 
top RH corner) log in again and type '/scripts/copy_course.sh' to
copy the tools, data and documents to the mapped directory on your
local hard disk.
