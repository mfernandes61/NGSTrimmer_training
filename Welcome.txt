Welcome to this IFR Docker container

It has 6 NGS trimming tools installed for you to experiment with on
some suppled data:
PRINSEQ
https://github.com/era7bio/prinseq.install
TRIMMOMATIC
http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic
CUTADAPT
http://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html
FASTX Toolkit
http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/install_ubuntu.txt
SICKLE
https://www.howtoinstall.co/en/ubuntu/xenial/sickle
CONDETRI
https://github.com/linneas/condetri
ERNE-filter
https://sourceforge.net/projects/erne/?source=navbar

fastqc is also supplied for you to check the data before and after trimming.
It is planned to have an advanced exercise involving comparing mapping success 
between raw and trimmed data to a refernce genome.

This training exercise was inspired by this paper (well worth reading!):
Paper: An Extensive Evaluation of Read Trimming Effects on Illumina NGS Data Analysis -
Cristian Del Fabbro , Simone Scalabrin , Michele Morgante, Federico M. Giorgi

*** NB ****
In Kitematic you will need to map the volume /coursehome to a directory 
on your hard disk. Next stop then start the container (buttons towards 
top RH corner) log in again and type '/scripts/copy_course.sh' to
copy the tools, data and documents to the mapped directory on your
local hard disk.
